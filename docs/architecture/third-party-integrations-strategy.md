# Third-Party Integrations Strategy

## 1. Introduction

The EasyCode platform will integrate with various third-party services to provide comprehensive functionality without reinventing specialized capabilities. This document outlines the key categories of third-party integrations and the general strategies for incorporating them into our microservice architecture. The aim is to ensure secure, reliable, flexible, and maintainable integrations.

## 2. General Principles for Third-Party Integrations

-   **Abstraction Layers (Adapters/Facades)**: Where feasible, build internal adapters for specific categories of services (e.g., `PaymentGatewayAdapter`, `TaxServiceAdapter`, `EmailProviderAdapter`). This allows switching between different third-party providers with minimal changes to core business logic in microservices.
-   **Secure Secrets Management**: All API keys, tokens, and other credentials for third-party services MUST be stored securely using a dedicated secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Google Secret Manager). Avoid hardcoding secrets in code or configuration files.
-   **Configuration Driven**: Endpoints, credentials (references to secrets), and key behavioral parameters for integrations should be configurable (globally or per-tenant where appropriate).
-   **Monitoring & Logging**: Implement comprehensive logging for requests and responses (with sensitive data redacted) to third-party services. Monitor the health, performance (latency, error rates), and cost of these integrations.
-   **Error Handling & Resilience**: Implement robust error handling, including retries with exponential backoff for transient network issues, and circuit breaker patterns for critical integrations to prevent cascading failures. Define clear fallback strategies where possible if a third-party service is unavailable.
-   **Rate Limiting (Outbound)**: Respect rate limits imposed by third-party providers. Implement outbound request throttling or queuing if necessary to avoid exceeding these limits.
-   **Data Privacy & Compliance (GDPR, etc.)**: For any integration involving Personal Identifiable Information (PII) or other sensitive data, carefully review the third-party vendor's data processing agreements and security practices. Ensure data sent is minimized and appropriate consent is obtained.
-   **Idempotency**: For critical write operations to third-party services (e.g., initiating a payment), design requests to be idempotent to prevent duplicate transactions in case of retries.

## 3. Key Integration Categories & Strategies

### a. Payment Processing Gateways
-   **Purpose**: Securely process various payment methods (cards, digital wallets, regional methods) for `pos-service` and `finance-service` (AR/AP).
-   **Strategy**:
    -   Prioritize client-side tokenization (using gateway SDKs) for direct card entry to minimize PCI DSS scope; EasyCode backend handles tokens only.
    -   Server-side API calls (via SDKs or direct) for creating charges, refunds, managing subscriptions, and settlement reconciliation.
    -   Implement a `PaymentGatewayAdapter` for flexibility.
-   **Examples**: Stripe, PayPal, Adyen, Square.

### b. Tax Calculation Services
-   **Purpose**: Provide accurate, real-time tax calculations (Sales Tax, VAT, GST) for `finance-service` and `pos-service`.
-   **Strategy**:
    -   Server-to-server API calls sending cart/invoice details and address information.
    -   Implement a `TaxServiceAdapter`.
    -   Cache results for identical, non-changing scenarios cautiously. Define fallback for service unavailability.
-   **Examples**: Avalara, TaxJar, Vertex.

### c. Shipping & Logistics APIs
-   **Purpose**: Enable `logistics-service` to fetch rates, generate labels, book shipments, and track deliveries.
-   **Strategy**:
    -   Server-to-server API calls.
    -   Implement a `ShippingCarrierAdapter` or `LogisticsPlatformAdapter`.
    -   Utilize webhooks from providers for real-time tracking updates where possible.
-   **Examples**: Shippo, EasyPost, Sendcloud, direct carrier APIs (UPS, FedEx, DHL).

### d. Identity Providers (IdP) for Federated Identity / SSO
-   **Purpose**: Allow users of client companies to log into EasyCode applications using their existing corporate credentials via `user-service`. Support social logins.
-   **Strategy**:
    -   Implement SAML 2.0 (SP) and OpenID Connect (OIDC - RP) protocols in `user-service`.
    -   Allow per-tenant configuration of their IdP metadata.
    -   Consider SCIM for user provisioning/de-provisioning from client IdPs.
    -   Use well-vetted security libraries for protocol handling.
-   **Examples**: Okta, Azure AD, Auth0, Google Identity Platform.

### e. Communication APIs
-   **Transactional Email Services**:
    -   **Purpose**: Reliable sending of system emails (alerts, notifications, password resets) via `notification-service`.
    -   **Strategy**: Server-side API calls, `EmailProviderAdapter`, webhook handling for bounces/complaints.
    -   **Examples**: SendGrid, Postmark, Amazon SES, Mailgun.
-   **SMS Services**:
    -   **Purpose**: Sending SMS notifications/communications via `notification-service`, `crm-service`, `pos-service`.
    -   **Strategy**: Server-side API calls, `SMSProviderAdapter`, delivery receipt handling, opt-out management.
    -   **Examples**: Twilio, Vonage (Nexmo), MessageBird.
-   **WhatsApp Business API Providers**:
    -   **Purpose**: Enable two-way WhatsApp communication for `crm-service`.
    -   **Strategy**: Server-side API integration adhering to WhatsApp policies, `WhatsAppProviderAdapter`, template message management.
    -   **Examples**: Twilio, Vonage, official Meta Business Solution Providers.

### f. Advanced AI Model Providers
-   **Purpose**: Access powerful, pre-trained models (LLMs, computer vision, etc.) for advanced AI features in services like `crm-service` or a central `ai-inference-service`.
-   **Strategy**:
    -   Server-to-server API calls, typically from `ai-inference-service` or directly from a business microservice.
    -   Strongly recommend using **Cloudflare AI Gateway** to manage API keys, cache responses, enforce rate limits, and provide unified analytics for these external AI calls.
    -   Utilize official SDKs. Extreme care with API key management and data privacy (anonymize/pseudonymize data sent if possible). Monitor token usage for cost control.
-   **Examples**: OpenAI (GPT series), Anthropic (Claude), Google Vertex AI (Gemini, PaLM).

### g. Mapping & Geocoding Services
-   **Purpose**: Provide address verification, geocoding, map displays, and route calculations for `logistics-service`, `crm-service`, `pos-service`.
-   **Strategy**:
    -   Client-side integration for map displays (using JS libraries).
    -   Server-side API calls (via `GeocodingServiceAdapter`) for geocoding, route calculations.
    -   Cache geocoding results for known addresses. Be mindful of usage limits/costs.
-   **Examples**: Google Maps Platform, Mapbox, Here Technologies, OpenStreetMap.

### h. Bank Feed Aggregation Services
-   **Purpose**: Automate bank reconciliation in `finance-service` by directly importing bank transactions.
-   **Strategy**:
    -   Secure client-side widget/SDK (e.g., Plaid Link) for end-user bank authentication.
    -   `finance-service` backend receives an access token, then makes server-to-server API calls to fetch transactions.
    -   Highest level of security for access tokens and fetched data. Regional availability and compliance are key.
-   **Examples**: Plaid, Yodlee, TrueLayer.

### i. Business Data Enrichment Services (Optional)
-   **Purpose**: Enhance `crm-service` data with additional company/contact information.
-   **Strategy**: Server-to-server API calls from `crm-service` (on new lead/contact or batch). Manage costs per enrichment.
-   **Examples**: Clearbit, ZoomInfo, Apollo.io.

## 4. Vendor Selection & Governance

While this document focuses on strategy per category, the actual selection of third-party vendors will involve:
-   Detailed feature comparison.
-   Pricing and contract negotiation.
-   Assessment of vendor security, compliance, and reliability.
-   Review of vendor support and SLAs.
-   Ease of integration and developer experience.

A lightweight governance process should be in place for onboarding new third-party integrations.
