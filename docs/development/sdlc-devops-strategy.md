# SDLC & DevOps Strategy for EasyCode

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the standardized Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), development workflow, testing methodologies, Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline, and deployment strategies for the EasyCode platform. The goal is to ensure the development and release of high-quality, reliable software at a sustainable pace, fostering collaboration and consistency across development teams.

## 2. Development Environments & Workflow

### a. Environments
-   **Local Development**: Individual developer setups using Docker Compose for running necessary microservices and backing stores (databases, message queues). Focus on mocking indirect dependencies. Standardized IDE configurations (linters, formatters) are encouraged.
-   **Shared Dev/Integration Environment(s)**: Cloud-hosted (e.g., Kubernetes) environments where developers deploy feature branches to test inter-service integrations before merging. Data is non-production and can be reset.
-   **Staging Environment (Pre-Production)**: A production-mirror environment for final UAT, performance testing, and full regression tests. Deployed from main/release branches. Data is production-like (anonymized/masked).
-   **Production Environment**: Live environment serving end-users. Highly available, scalable, and monitored. Deployments are controlled and automated.

### b. Git Branching Strategy
-   **GitFlow (Recommended)**:
    -   `main` (or `master`): Production-ready code, tagged for releases.
    -   `develop`: Main integration branch for ongoing development.
    -   `feature/<feature-name>`: For new features, branched from `develop`.
    -   `release/<version>`: For release preparation, branched from `develop`.
    -   `hotfix/<issue-id>`: For critical production fixes, branched from `main`.
-   **Pull/Merge Requests (PRs/MRs)**: Mandatory for all code changes into `develop` and `main`. Requires code reviews (e.g., at least one approval) and passing CI checks.

### c. Configuration Management
-   Configuration is separated from code (environment variables, config files).
-   Secrets are managed via a secure secrets management system (e.g., Vault, cloud provider's KMS/Secrets Manager) and injected into environments.
-   Configuration for Dev/Staging/Prod is managed via environment-specific files or a central configuration server, applied during deployment.

## 3. Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) Pipeline

### a. Goals
-   Automation, consistency, early feedback, speed, reliability, traceability.

### b. Key Stages
-   **Continuous Integration (CI) - Triggered on commit/PR to feature branches**:
    1.  Code Checkout
    2.  Build (compile, resolve dependencies)
    3.  Linting & Static Code Analysis (SAST)
    4.  Unit Testing (with code coverage checks)
    5.  Security Scanning (dependencies)
    6.  Artifact Creation (e.g., Docker image) & Storage (Container Registry)
    7.  Scoped Integration Testing (service with its DB or mocks)
    8.  Notifications (success/failure)
-   **Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD) - Triggered on merge to `develop`/`release`/`main` or manual promotion**:
    1.  Environment Provisioning/Configuration (IaC tools like Terraform)
    2.  Deployment to Dev/Integration Environment (from `develop` or feature branches)
    3.  Automated End-to-End (E2E) & further Integration/Contract Tests
    4.  Promotion to Staging Environment (from `develop` or `release` branch)
    5.  User Acceptance Testing (UAT) & Performance/Load Testing (on Staging)
    6.  Promotion to Production Environment (from `main`/`release` branch, often manual approval)
    7.  Post-Deployment Verification/Smoke Tests
    8.  Monitoring & Rollback procedures enabled.

### c. Tooling (Examples)
-   Git (GitHub/GitLab), CI/CD Server (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins), Build tools (Maven, npm, pip), Docker, Container Registries, Kubernetes, Static Analysis (SonarQube), Security Scanners (Snyk, Trivy), Testing Frameworks (JUnit, Jest, Cypress), IaC (Terraform).

### d. Pipeline per Microservice & Monorepo Considerations
-   Each microservice has its own pipeline. In a monorepo, pipelines should be optimized to build/deploy only changed services and their dependents.

## 4. Testing Strategy

### a. Testing Philosophy
-   Test Pyramid, Shift-Left, Automation, Continuous Testing.

### b. Types of Testing
-   **Unit Tests**: Developer-written, isolated, high coverage, fast.
-   **Integration Tests**: Internal (service + DB) and Service-to-Service (API contracts).
-   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**: User flow simulation across services/UI.
-   **Contract Tests**: (e.g., Pact) Ensure API compatibility between services.
-   **Performance & Load Tests**: Against Staging for critical user journeys/APIs.
-   **Security Testing**: SAST, DAST, Dependency Scanning, periodic Penetration Testing.
-   **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Manual validation by Product Owners/stakeholders on Staging.

### c. Test Data Management
-   Strategies for generating, managing, and anonymizing/masking test data. Staging aims for production-like data.

## 5. Deployment Strategy

### a. Containerization & Orchestration
-   **Docker** for containerizing all microservices.
-   **Kubernetes (K8s)** recommended for orchestration (managed K8s preferred). Declarative configurations (YAML/Helm).

### b. Deployment Patterns
-   **Production/Staging**: Rolling Updates (default), Blue/Green, or Canary releases to ensure zero-downtime and safe rollouts.

### c. Database Schema Migrations
-   Use tools like Flyway/Liquibase. Scripts version-controlled with code. Automated application during CI/CD. Focus on backward-compatible changes.

### d. Runtime Configuration & Secrets
-   Injected via K8s ConfigMaps/Secrets or dedicated servers (Vault).

### e. Rollback Procedures
-   Automated (via K8s health checks) and practiced manual rollback plans.

### f. Health Checks
-   Mandatory liveness and readiness probes for all services in Kubernetes.

## 6. Quality Gates & Release Criteria

-   **For Merge to `develop`**:
    -   All unit and relevant integration tests PASS.
    -   Code coverage meets or exceeds target (e.g., 80%).
    -   No new CRITICAL/BLOCKER static analysis or security scan issues.
    -   Successful code review (e.g., at least one approval).
    -   Feature branch deployed and tested in a shared Dev/Integration environment.
-   **For Promotion to Staging (from `develop` or `release` branch)**:
    -   All CI checks pass for the branch.
    -   Successful deployment and E2E tests in Dev/Integration environment.
-   **For Release to Production (from `main` or `release` branch)**:
    -   All E2E tests PASS on Staging.
    -   Successful UAT sign-off from Product Owner/stakeholders.
    -   Performance and load tests meet Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs).
    -   No outstanding CRITICAL vulnerabilities from security scans.
    -   Deployment plan reviewed and approved.
    -   Rollback plan confirmed.

## 7. Roles & Responsibilities (Brief Overview)

-   **Developers**: Adherence to coding standards, writing unit/integration tests, participating in code reviews, ensuring CI pipeline passes for their changes.
-   **QA Engineers/Testers**: Developing and maintaining E2E test suites, contract tests, performance tests; executing UAT (or coordinating it); quality reporting.
-   **DevOps/SRE Team**: Maintaining and evolving the CI/CD infrastructure, deployment automation, monitoring production systems, managing environments.
-   **Product Owners/Managers**: Defining requirements and acceptance criteria, leading UAT, giving final approval for production releases.
-   **Security Team**: Defining security policies, assisting with security testing tools and reviews, managing vulnerability responses.
