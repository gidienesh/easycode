# Code & API Documentation Standards for EasyCode

## 1. Introduction

This document establishes consistent standards for code and API documentation across all EasyCode microservices. Adherence to these standards is crucial for code maintainability, effective collaboration, smooth onboarding of new developers, and ensuring the consumability of our APIs by both internal and potentially external developers.

Good documentation is not an afterthought but an integral part of the development process.

## 2. In-Code Documentation Practices

These practices apply to the comments and documentation strings written directly within the source code of each microservice.

### a. General Principles
-   **Clarity & Conciseness**: Write documentation that is easy to understand. Avoid jargon where simpler terms suffice. Be brief but informative.
-   **Document "Why," Not Just "What" or "How"**: Code often explains *what* it's doing and *how*. Comments should focus on *why* a particular design choice was made, explain complex or non-obvious business logic, or highlight critical assumptions.
-   **Keep Documentation Up-to-Date**: Outdated documentation is misleading. Documentation MUST be reviewed and updated as part of the code change and pull/merge request review process.
-   **Target Audience**: Assume the reader is another developer on the team with reasonable familiarity with the programming language but not necessarily with the specific code block.
-   **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Avoid comments that merely restate what the code clearly and simply shows. Comments should add value.

### b. File/Module Level Documentation
-   **Purpose**: Every source file or logical module should begin with a block comment describing its overall purpose, its main responsibilities, and any key architectural notes if applicable.
-   **Content**: Brief description of the module/file's role, key classes/functions it exposes, and important external dependencies or interactions.

### c. Class/Interface Level Documentation
-   **Purpose**: Describe the purpose, responsibility, and usage of each class or interface.
-   **Content**: What the class represents or what the interface defines, a summary of key methods/properties, and usage examples for complex or non-obvious cases.

### d. Function/Method Level Documentation (Most Critical)
-   **Purpose**: All public functions/methods, and any complex or non-obvious private ones, MUST be documented.
-   **Content**:
    -   **Summary**: A concise description of what the function/method does.
    -   **Parameters**: For each parameter: its name, type, a clear description, and any constraints.
    -   **Return Value**: The type and description of the return value. For complex objects, describe key properties. State if void.
    -   **Exceptions/Errors Thrown**: Specific exceptions/errors the function might explicitly throw and under what conditions.
    -   **Side Effects**: Any important side effects (e.g., database writes, external API calls).
    -   **Algorithm/Logic**: For complex functions, a brief explanation of the implemented algorithm or business logic.
    -   **Usage Example (Optional)**: For complex APIs.

### e. Inline Comments
-   **Purpose**: Explain complex, tricky, or non-obvious sections of code *within* a function/method body.
-   **Use For**: Explaining workarounds, clarifying complex regular expressions or algorithm steps, marking `TODO:/FIXME:/OPTIMIZE:` comments (with explanation/ticket #), or explaining "magic" constants that cannot be named constants.
-   **Avoid**: Commenting obvious code or using comments for version control.

### f. Language-Specific Conventions & Tooling
-   **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Utilize **JSDoc**. Tools like TypeDoc can generate HTML documentation.
-   **Python**: Adhere to **PEP 257 (Docstring Conventions)**. Common styles include reStructuredText (for Sphinx), Google Style, or NumPy style. Sphinx is recommended for documentation generation.
-   **Java**: Utilize **JavaDoc**.
-   **Go**: Follow **Godoc** conventions.
-   *(Other languages used in the project should adopt their respective idiomatic documentation standards and tooling.)*

### g. Enforcement & Review
-   **Linters**: Configure linters (e.g., ESLint plugins for JSDoc, Pylint/Flake8 for Python) to check for the presence and basic format of documentation blocks.
-   **Code Reviews**: Documentation review is a MANDATORY part of the code review process. Reviewers must check for clarity, accuracy, and completeness.

## 3. API Documentation Standards

This section applies to documenting the RESTful (and potentially GraphQL) APIs exposed by microservices.

### a. Source of Truth & Specification
-   **OpenAPI Specification (OAS)**: For all RESTful microservices, the OpenAPI Specification (version 3.x recommended) is the **single source of truth**.
-   **Approach**: A "Specification First" or "Design First" approach to API development is highly recommended. The OpenAPI spec should be created or updated *before or alongside* the code.
-   **Location**: Each microservice MUST maintain its OpenAPI specification file(s) (e.g., `openapi.yaml` or `openapi.json`) within its source code repository.

### b. Key Content of API Documentation (derived from OAS)
-   **Endpoints**: Clearly listed with HTTP methods, paths, and concise descriptions.
-   **Request Parameters**: Path, query, header parameters â€“ each with name, type, description, and requirement status.
-   **Request Body Schemas**: Detailed JSON schemas (or examples) for request payloads, including field names, types, descriptions, and validation rules.
-   **Response Schemas**: Detailed JSON schemas (or examples) for all possible HTTP response statuses (200, 201, 400, 401, 403, 404, 500).
-   **Authentication & Authorization**: Clear documentation on how to authenticate (e.g., JWT in Authorization header) and any specific permissions/roles required.
-   **Rate Limiting**: Information on applicable rate limits.
-   **Error Handling**: Common error responses and their meanings.
-   **Versioning**: Strategy for API versioning (e.g., URL path `/v1/...`, headers).
-   **Examples**: Example requests and responses for key endpoints. "Try it out" functionality in generated docs is highly beneficial.

### c. Tools for Generation & Publication
-   **Generation**: Tools like Swagger UI, Redoc, or Stoplight Elements will be used to generate interactive HTML documentation from the OpenAPI specification files.
-   **Automation**: This generation process MUST be automated as part of the CI/CD pipeline for each service.
-   **Publication**: Generated API documentation will be published to a central, internal **Developer Portal**.

### d. Maintenance & Review
-   **Code Review Integration**: Changes to API contracts (OpenAPI spec) MUST be part of the code review process.
-   **Automated Linting**: OpenAPI specification files should be linted in CI (e.g., using Spectral) for validity and adherence to style guidelines.
-   **Accuracy**: Regularly review and test API documentation against live services.

### e. GraphQL APIs (If Applicable)
-   For services exposing GraphQL APIs, the GraphQL schema itself serves as the primary contract.
-   Tools like GraphiQL or GraphQL Playground, which provide built-in interactive documentation capabilities, should be made available.

## 4. Living Document
These documentation standards are intended to be a living guide. They will be reviewed periodically and updated as our tools, processes, and best practices evolve. Feedback and suggestions for improvement are welcome.
