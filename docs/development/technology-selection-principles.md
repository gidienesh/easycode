# Technology Selection Principles for EasyCode

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the guiding principles for selecting software libraries, frameworks, tools, and third-party services (collectively "technologies") for the EasyCode platform. Adhering to these principles will help ensure a robust, maintainable, secure, scalable, and cost-effective system, while fostering innovation and developer productivity.

## 2. Core Principles

### a. Prioritize Open Source Software (OSS)

-   **Preference**: Where feasible and appropriate, EasyCode prioritizes the use of well-maintained, widely adopted, and permissively licensed open-source software.
-   **Benefits**: Cost savings, transparency, community support, flexibility, opportunities for contribution.
-   **Evaluation Criteria for OSS**:
    -   **License Compatibility**: Ensure OSS licenses (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0, BSD) are compatible with EasyCode's intended use and distribution model. Carefully review licenses like GPL/AGPL to understand their implications, especially for distributed services.
    -   **Community & Maintenance**: Favor projects with active development, responsive maintainers, regular updates, comprehensive documentation, and a strong user community.
    -   **Security**: Assess the project's security track record, vulnerability reporting/patching process, and overall code quality. Utilize tools to scan OSS dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
    -   **Maturity & Stability**: Prefer stable, mature libraries over beta or experimental ones for critical path functionalities.
    -   **Performance & Scalability**: Evaluate if the OSS can meet EasyCode's performance and scalability requirements for the intended use case.
    -   **Ecosystem Fit**: Consider how well the OSS integrates with our existing technology stack and architectural patterns.

### b. Ensure Cloudflare Workers/Edge Compatibility (Critical for Edge Code)

-   **Requirement**: For any JavaScript/TypeScript code or libraries intended to run directly within the Cloudflare Workers runtime environment (including Cloudflare Pages Functions for Next.js edge rendering, or custom Worker scripts for API gateway logic, etc.), **compatibility is paramount.**
-   **Runtime Considerations**: The Cloudflare Workers runtime is based on V8 isolates and adheres to web standards (e.g., Fetch API, Web Crypto). It does not provide the full Node.js API surface.
-   **Library Selection for Edge**:
    -   Actively prefer isomorphic/universal libraries designed to run in both Node.js and browser/worker environments.
    -   Avoid libraries with heavy or unavoidable dependencies on Node.js-specific APIs (e.g., direct file system access in certain modes, OS-level calls, some native Node.js modules) unless suitable shims or Worker-compatible alternatives exist.
    -   Check library documentation for explicit Cloudflare Workers or edge runtime support.
-   **Verification**: New, non-trivial libraries intended for edge execution **must** undergo a Proof of Concept (POC) or thorough testing in a Worker environment to confirm compatibility, performance, and correctness before being adopted for production use.

### c. Strategic Use of Proprietary/Commercial Software & Services

-   **Justification**: Proprietary or commercial software and third-party services (SaaS) should be used when:
    -   A suitable open-source alternative does not exist or fails to meet critical functional, performance, security, or compliance requirements.
    -   It provides a significant time-to-market advantage or specialized expertise that is not feasible to build in-house (e.g., payment gateways, advanced tax calculation services, specialized AI model providers).
-   **Evaluation Criteria**:
    -   **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)**: Including licensing fees, integration costs, maintenance, and potential vendor lock-in.
    -   **Vendor Reliability & Support**: Assess the vendor's stability, reputation, support responsiveness, and SLAs.
    -   **Integration Complexity & API Quality**: Evaluate the ease and robustness of integration.
    -   **Security & Compliance**: Ensure the vendor meets EasyCode's security and compliance standards.
    -   **Exit Strategy**: Consider the implications and difficulty if needing to migrate away from the vendor in the future.

## 3. Technology Evaluation & Approval Process (Lightweight)

-   **Proposal**: Developers proposing a new significant library, framework, or service should briefly document their choice, how it aligns with these principles, and any alternatives considered.
-   **Review**: This can be part of a team tech talk, an internal RFC process for major components, or review by tech leads/architecture group to ensure consistency and avoid unnecessary proliferation of similar tools.
-   **Proof of Concepts (POCs)**: Strongly encouraged for critical or unfamiliar technologies, especially for edge compatibility or performance-sensitive areas.

## 4. Contribution to Open Source

-   EasyCode encourages developers to contribute back to the open-source projects it utilizes, whether through bug reports, documentation improvements, or code contributions, where appropriate and feasible.

By following these principles, EasyCode aims to build a technology stack that is robust, modern, secure, and adaptable to future needs, leveraging the best of open-source innovation while strategically employing commercial solutions where they provide clear advantages.
