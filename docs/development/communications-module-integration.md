# Communications Module Integration with CRM Service

## Overview

The Communications Module has been successfully integrated into the CRM service, providing a comprehensive solution for managing all customer communications across multiple channels. This integration leverages the existing activity tracking system while adding specialized communications functionality.

## Architecture

### Backend (CRM Service)

#### 1. Communications Controller (`services/crm-service/src/controllers/communications.controller.ts`)

**Key Features:**
- **Unified Communications Management**: Single endpoint for all communication types
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter by type, direction, date range, contact, account, and search terms
- **Statistics**: Real-time communication analytics
- **Bulk Operations**: Mass delete and export functionality
- **CRUD Operations**: Full create, read, update, delete capabilities

**Endpoints:**
```typescript
// Get all communications with filters
GET /v1/communications?type=email&direction=outbound&search=proposal

// Get communications by type
GET /v1/communications/type/email

// Get communication statistics
GET /v1/communications/stats

// Get specific communication
GET /v1/communications/:id

// Update communication
PUT /v1/communications/:id

// Delete communication
DELETE /v1/communications/:id

// Bulk delete communications
DELETE /v1/communications/bulk/delete

// Export communications
GET /v1/communications/export?format=json|csv
```

#### 2. Communications Routes (`services/crm-service/src/routes/v1/communicationsRoutes.ts`)

**Route Structure:**
- RESTful API design
- Consistent error handling
- Authentication ready (commented out for development)
- Proper HTTP status codes

#### 3. Data Models

**Leverages existing CRM activity models:**
- `EmailActivity`: Email communications with attachments and threading
- `CallActivity`: Phone calls with duration and recording support
- `SmsActivity`: SMS messages with delivery status
- `WhatsAppActivity`: WhatsApp messages with media support
- `MeetingActivity`: Scheduled meetings with attendees
- `NoteActivity`: Internal notes and documentation

### Frontend Integration

#### 1. CRM API Service (`apps/main-ui/src/services/crmApi.ts`)

**Enhanced with communications endpoints:**
```typescript
// Get all communications
crmApiService.getAllCommunications(filters)

// Get communications by type
crmApiService.getCommunicationsByType('email', filters)

// Get statistics
crmApiService.getCommunicationStats()

// CRUD operations
crmApiService.getCommunicationById(id)
crmApiService.updateCommunication(id, data)
crmApiService.deleteCommunication(id)
crmApiService.bulkDeleteCommunications(ids)
crmApiService.exportCommunications(format, filters)
```

#### 2. Communications Hook (`apps/main-ui/src/hooks/useCommunications.ts`)

**React Hook Features:**
- State management for communications
- Loading and error handling
- Real-time statistics
- Contact and account integration
- Form handling for all communication types

#### 3. TypeScript Types (`apps/main-ui/src/types/crm.ts`)

**Comprehensive type definitions:**
- Activity types for all communication channels
- Form data types for creating communications
- Filter and search types
- UI component types

## Features

### 1. Multi-Channel Support
- **Email**: Full email management with threading and attachments
- **WhatsApp**: Business WhatsApp integration with media support
- **SMS**: SMS messaging with delivery tracking
- **Phone Calls**: Call logging with duration and recording
- **Meetings**: Meeting scheduling and management
- **Notes**: Internal documentation and notes

### 2. Advanced Filtering & Search
- Filter by communication type
- Filter by direction (inbound/outbound/internal)
- Date range filtering
- Contact and account filtering
- Full-text search across subjects and content
- Real-time filtering with debounced search

### 3. Analytics & Statistics
- Total communications count
- Breakdown by communication type
- Direction analysis (inbound/outbound/internal)
- Real-time statistics updates
- Export capabilities (JSON/CSV)

### 4. Bulk Operations
- Mass delete communications
- Bulk export functionality
- Batch processing capabilities
- Progress tracking for large operations

### 5. Integration Points
- **Contact Management**: Link communications to contacts
- **Account Management**: Associate communications with accounts
- **Activity Feed**: Unified activity timeline
- **User Management**: Track communication ownership
- **Tenant Support**: Multi-tenant architecture

## Usage Examples

### Frontend Integration

```typescript
import { useCommunications } from '../hooks/useCommunications';

function CommunicationsPage() {
  const {
    communications,
    loading,
    error,
    loadCommunications,
    getStatistics,
    createEmail,
    createWhatsApp
  } = useCommunications();

  useEffect(() => {
    loadCommunications();
  }, []);

  const handleSendEmail = async () => {
    await createEmail({
      to: 'client@example.com',
      subject: 'Project Update',
      body: 'Here is the latest update...',
      contactId: 'contact-1'
    });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {loading ? <Loader /> : (
        <CommunicationsList communications={communications} />
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### API Integration

```typescript
import crmApiService from '../services/crmApi';

// Get all communications
const communications = await crmApiService.getAllCommunications({
  type: 'email',
  direction: 'outbound',
  dateFrom: '2024-06-01',
  dateTo: '2024-06-30'
});

// Get statistics
const stats = await crmApiService.getCommunicationStats();

// Create new communication
const newEmail = await crmApiService.logEmailActivity({
  tenantId: 'tenant-1',
  direction: 'outbound',
  visibility: 'team',
  activityTimestamp: new Date(),
  fromAddress: 'company@example.com',
  toAddresses: ['client@example.com'],
  subject: 'New Proposal',
  bodyPreview: 'Here is our proposal...',
  contactId: 'contact-1'
});
```

## Testing

NEXT_PUBLIC_CRM_API_URL=http://localhost:3004/api/v1
```

### CORS Configuration
The CRM service is configured to accept requests from the frontend application.

## Security Considerations

### Authentication
- JWT-based authentication (ready for implementation)
- Role-based access control
- Tenant isolation

### Data Protection
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection
- Rate limiting (recommended for production)

### Privacy
- GDPR compliance considerations
- Data retention policies
- Audit logging

## Performance Optimization

### Backend
- Database indexing for common queries
- Pagination for large datasets
- Caching for statistics
- Connection pooling

### Frontend
- Virtual scrolling for large lists
- Debounced search
- Optimistic updates
- Background data refresh

## Monitoring & Logging

### Metrics to Track
- API response times
- Error rates
- Communication volume by type
- User engagement metrics

### Logging
- Request/response logging
- Error tracking
- Performance monitoring
- Audit trails

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Real-time Notifications**: WebSocket integration for live updates
2. **Advanced Analytics**: Detailed reporting and insights
3. **Automation**: Automated communication workflows
4. **Integration**: Third-party service integrations (Slack, Teams, etc.)
5. **AI Features**: Smart categorization and response suggestions

### Technical Improvements
1. **Database Migration**: Move from mock data to persistent storage
2. **Caching Layer**: Redis integration for performance
3. **Message Queue**: Background processing for large operations
4. **File Storage**: S3/R2 integration for attachments and media
5. **Search Engine**: Elasticsearch integration for advanced search

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. CORS Errors
**Problem**: Frontend can't access CRM API
**Solution**: Ensure CORS is properly configured in CRM service

#### 2. Date Format Issues
**Problem**: Date filtering not working
**Solution**: Use ISO 8601 format for dates (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ)

#### 3. Type Errors
**Problem**: TypeScript compilation errors
**Solution**: Ensure all types are properly imported and defined

#### 4. Mock Data Issues
**Problem**: No data showing in frontend
**Solution**: Check that mock data is properly initialized in controller

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by setting `NODE_ENV=development` and checking console output.
