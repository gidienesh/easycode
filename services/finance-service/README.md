## Technical Aspects (Current Implementation)
*   **Framework**: Next.js (App Router for APIs)
*   **Language**: TypeScript
*   **Database ORM**: Prisma (with PostgreSQL provider)
*   **API Style**: RESTful JSON APIs
*   **Testing**: Unit test stubs created for existing API routes (Jest-like structure).
*   **Deployment**: Placeholder for OpenNext configuration for serverless deployment.

**Note:** Due to environment limitations preventing dependency installation (`npm install`, `pnpm install`), many parts of the service (Prisma client actual usage, running tests, building with OpenNext) are based on placeholders and simulated logic. The focus has been on schema definition, API route structure, request/response handling, and business logic simulation within the handlers.

This README now reflects the comprehensive feature set planned and partially implemented for the finance service.Successfully replaced the content of `services/finance-service/README.md` with the new comprehensive feature list.

All steps for this subtask are complete.
1.  Read existing README.md (and determined it could be fully replaced).
2.  Overwrote README.md with the new detailed content.

I can now submit the report.
