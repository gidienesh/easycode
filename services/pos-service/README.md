# Point of Sale (POS) Service (@easycode/pos-service)

This service provides a comprehensive, versatile, and configurable Point of Sale solution designed to cater to various business types. It supports robust offline capabilities, multi-channel integrations, and a headless architecture.

## Core Responsibility
To manage all aspects of point-of-sale operations, including cart management, transaction processing (sales, returns, exchanges), payment integration, receipt generation, session management, and integration with inventory, customer, and finance systems, both online and offline.

## 1. Core POS Features & Offline Architecture

### a. Transaction Processing
-   **Sales**: Item addition (scan, manual, quick buttons), quantity adjustment, price overrides (permissioned), discount application (item/cart), tax calculation.
-   **Returns**: With or without original receipt (configurable policies), refund processing.
-   **Exchanges**: Seamless combination of return and new sale.
-   **Payment Types**: Cash, Card (EMV, tokenization), Gift Cards, Loyalty Points, Digital Wallets, On-Account Sales. Supports split payments.
-   **Layaway/On-Account**: Management of layaway orders (deposits, payments, fulfillment) and on-account sales for B2B/approved customers.

### b. Offline Capability (Store-and-Forward)
-   **Client-Side Database (IndexedDB/SQLite)**:
    -   Stores essential products, pricing, basic customer data, ongoing transaction carts, and a log of completed offline transactions.
    -   Manages a sync queue status for offline transactions.
-   **Synchronization Mechanism**:
    -   **Initial Data Seeding & Delta Updates**: Client fetches necessary data from server when online; delta updates minimize data transfer.
    -   **Offline Transaction Queueing**: Transactions completed offline are logged locally.
    -   **Secure Upload & Server Processing**: Queued transactions are sent to the server in batches upon reconnection. Server acknowledges and processes, handling conflicts.
    -   **Conflict Resolution**: Strategies for inventory, pricing, promotions, and customer data discrepancies between offline sale time and server sync time.
-   **Supporting Server Endpoints**: For data seeding and receiving queued offline transactions.

### c. Product Information & Pricing
-   Integrates with `inventory-service` (or a central catalog) for product details.
-   Provides condensed product data for offline use.
-   Real-time stock checks if online; advisory/last-synced stock if offline.
-   Accurate tax calculation via `finance-service` or tax module.

### d. Receipt Management
-   Generates digital and printable receipts.
-   Standard JSON-based receipt data structure.
-   Supports tenant-configurable templates (header, footer, line items, promotional messages, branding).
-   Email/SMS receipt dispatch via `notification-service`.

### e. Session Management
-   Shift open/close procedures (functional offline).
-   Cash drawer reconciliation, including offline transactions once synced.
-   Generation of X/Z reports (consolidating online and synced offline data).

## 2. Configuration Model (Tenant-Specific Customization)

-   **UI Customization Support**: Backend stores preferences for frontend UI flexibility (quick access grids, screen layout profiles, basic branding).
-   **Payment Methods**: Tenants define active payment types, link to gateway configurations, and set properties (e.g., surcharges, open cash drawer).
-   **Receipt Templates**: CRUD management for multiple, customizable receipt templates.
-   **Tax Configuration**: Integration with central tax service; POS stores default tax zones and display preferences.
-   **Discount & Promotion Engine**: Tenant-defined discounts (item/cart, %/fixed, BOGO, tiered) and promotions (duration, conditions, coupons) evaluated by a rule engine.
-   **Hardware Profiles**: Server-side storage of configurations for various POS hardware setups (printers, scanners, payment terminals).

## 4. API and Extensibility Strategy

-   Secured with JWT, tenant-aware, fine-grained permissions.
-   Standard HTTP status codes and idempotency support for critical operations.

### b. Webhook Events
-   Emits events for key POS actions (e.g., `sale.completed`, `shift.closed`, `offline_transactions.synced`) to a message broker or HTTP endpoints for decoupled integration.

### c. Headless POS Support
