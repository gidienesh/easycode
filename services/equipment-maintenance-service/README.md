# Equipment Maintenance Service (@easycode/equipment-maintenance-service)

This service is designed for EasyCode's clients who need to manage the maintenance of equipment. This can include equipment they service for their own customers (e.g., generators, air conditioners, pumps) or their own internal assets.

## Core Responsibilities (High-Level)
- Equipment Registry & Asset Management
- Maintenance Planning & Scheduling (Preventive & Corrective)
- Work Order Management
- Configurable Checklist Management
- Service History & Reporting

(Detailed modules and features to be elaborated based on architectural discussions.)

This service will be tenant-isolated and is expected to integrate with other services like Inventory (for spare parts) and potentially Logistics (for technician dispatch).
