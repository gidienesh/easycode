# Equipment Maintenance Service (@easycode/equipment-maintenance-service)

## 1. Service Overview

Manages equipment assets, scheduling preventive and corrective maintenance, tracking service history, and utilizing configurable checklists for maintenance procedures. This service is designed for EasyCode's clients who need to manage the maintenance of equipment, which can include equipment they service for their own customers (e.g., generators, air conditioners, pumps) or their own internal assets.

## 2. Tech Stack

Built with TypeScript and Node.js, leveraging Turborepo for monorepo management. It's designed for deployment on cloud infrastructure, compatible with strategies like OpenNext/Cloudflare for relevant parts of the ecosystem.

## 3. Core Features and Capabilities

### 3.1. Equipment Asset Management
1.  **Asset Registry**: Register new equipment with comprehensive details (e.g., ID, type, model, serial number, manufacturer, purchase date, location, custodian).
2.  **Hierarchical Asset Structure**: Define parent-child relationships between assets (e.g., a pump as part of a larger HVAC system).
3.  **Customizable Asset Types**: Configure different types of equipment with specific attributes and maintenance protocols.
4.  **Status Tracking**: Monitor the operational status of equipment (e.g., active, inactive, under maintenance, retired).
5.  **QR Code/Barcode Integration**: Associate assets with QR codes or barcodes for easy identification and access to information via mobile devices.

### 3.2. Maintenance Planning & Scheduling
1.  **Preventive Maintenance (PM)**:
    1.1. Define PM schedules based on time intervals (e.g., monthly), usage metrics (e.g., operating hours), or condition-based triggers.
    1.2. Generate work orders automatically based on PM schedules.
    1.3. Assign PM tasks to technicians or teams.
2.  **Corrective Maintenance (CM)**:
    2.1. Log equipment breakdowns or issues reported by users or sensors.
    2.2. Create work orders for CM tasks.
    2.3. Prioritize CM tasks based on urgency and impact.
3.  **Calendar View**: Visualize maintenance schedules and technician availability.
4.  **Resource Allocation**: Assign necessary resources, including technicians and spare parts, to maintenance tasks.

### 3.3. Work Order Management
1.  **Work Order Creation**: Generate work orders with detailed information, including asset details, problem description, required tasks, assigned technician, and due dates.
2.  **Task Management**: Break down work orders into specific tasks or steps.
3.  **Status Tracking**: Monitor the progress of work orders (e.g., open, in progress, on hold, completed, closed).
4.  **Labor Time Tracking**: Record the time spent by technicians on each work order.
5.  **Parts Consumption**: Track spare parts used for each work order, integrating with `inventory-service`.
6.  **Digital Signatures**: Capture technician and supervisor signatures on work order completion.

### 3.4. Configurable Checklist Management
1.  **Checklist Templates**: Create and manage standardized checklist templates for various maintenance procedures and equipment types.
2.  **Dynamic Checklists**: Attach specific checklists to work orders.
3.  **Task Execution**: Allow technicians to complete checklists step-by-step, capturing readings, pass/fail status, and notes for each item.
4.  **Compliance & Standardization**: Ensure adherence to standard operating procedures and safety protocols.

### 3.5. Service History & Reporting
1.  **Comprehensive Asset History**: Maintain a complete record of all maintenance activities, parts used, costs incurred, and condition changes for each asset.
2.  **Reporting & Analytics**: Generate reports on maintenance costs, equipment downtime, technician performance, PM compliance, and other key performance indicators (KPIs).
3.  **Audit Trails**: Track all changes and updates to maintenance records and asset information.

### 3.6. Potential AI Enhancements
AI can significantly enhance equipment maintenance capabilities:
1.  **Predictive Maintenance (PdM)**: Analyze sensor data and historical patterns to predict equipment failures or estimate Remaining Useful Life (RUL), enabling proactive maintenance.
2.  **AI-Powered Anomaly Detection**: Identify unusual equipment performance or sensor readings that may indicate early-stage issues, triggering alerts or investigations.
3.  **Optimized Spare Parts Inventory & Scheduling**: Forecast demand for spare parts based on predictive maintenance insights and optimize maintenance schedules to minimize downtime and resource conflicts.
4.  **AI-Assisted Fault Diagnosis & Troubleshooting**: Provide technicians with intelligent guidance, diagnostic steps, or solutions based on symptoms and historical data.

## 4. Key Integration Points with Other Services

-   **`user-service`**: For authenticating and authorizing users (e.g., technicians, maintenance managers, administrators) accessing the service. User roles and permissions determine access to features and data.
-   **`tenant-service`**: For managing tenant-specific configurations, such as custom asset types, checklist templates, maintenance workflows, and ensuring data isolation between tenants.
-   **`inventory-service`**: To check availability, reserve, and record the consumption of spare parts used during maintenance work orders. This ensures accurate inventory levels and parts costing.
-   **`finance-service`**: To report maintenance costs (labor, parts, external services) associated with assets and work orders, contributing to overall asset lifecycle cost tracking.
-   **`notification-service`**: For sending reminders about upcoming scheduled preventive maintenance, alerts on critical equipment issues or failures, and notifications on work order status changes to relevant personnel.
-   **`logistics-service` (Potential)**: For advanced scenarios involving technician dispatch, route optimization, and field service management, especially for clients servicing equipment over a wide geographical area.

## 5. Frontend & UI Consumption

Provides APIs and data that can be utilized by frontend applications, potentially built using components from the shared UI library in `apps/main-ui/`, to manage equipment and maintenance tasks. This allows for a consistent user experience for maintenance staff and managers.
