# Equipment Maintenance Service (@easycode/equipment-maintenance-service)

This service is designed for EasyCode's clients who need to manage the maintenance of equipment. This can include equipment they service for their own customers (e.g., generators, air conditioners, pumps) or their own internal assets.

## Core Responsibilities (High-Level)
- Equipment Registry & Asset Management
- Maintenance Planning & Scheduling (Preventive & Corrective)
- Work Order Management
- Configurable Checklist Management
- Service History & Reporting

(Detailed modules and features to be elaborated based on architectural discussions.)

This service will be tenant-isolated and is expected to integrate with other services like Inventory (for spare parts) and potentially Logistics (for technician dispatch).

## Potential AI Enhancements
AI will play a crucial role in transforming equipment maintenance towards predictive and intelligent operations:
-   **Predictive Maintenance (PdM)**: To predict equipment failures or Remaining Useful Life (RUL).
-   **AI-Powered Anomaly Detection**: To identify unusual equipment performance indicating early-stage issues.
-   **Optimized Spare Parts Inventory & Scheduling**: To forecast parts demand and optimize maintenance schedules.
-   **AI-Assisted Fault Diagnosis & Troubleshooting**: To guide technicians in diagnosing and resolving equipment issues.

For more details on the overall AI strategy and infrastructure, see the [AI Integration Strategy](../../docs/architecture/ai-integration-strategy.md).
