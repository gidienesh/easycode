# Project Management Service (@easycode/project-management-service)

This service provides project management capabilities for two primary user groups:
1.  **EasyCode's Clients**: To manage their own internal or customer-facing projects. Data for client projects is tenant-isolated.
2.  **EasyCode Internal Staff**: To manage internal projects, such as client implementations, software development sprints, or other company initiatives.

## Core Responsibilities (High-Level)
- Project Definition & Planning
- Task Management
- Resource Management
- Time Tracking
- Collaboration & Communication
- Progress Monitoring & Reporting

(Detailed modules and features to be elaborated based on architectural discussions.)

Tenancy is a key consideration to ensure data isolation and appropriate access controls for different user groups.
